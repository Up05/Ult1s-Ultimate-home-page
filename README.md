# Ult1s-Ultimate-home-page
The best homepage website design possible.


# Are you bored of those lame \*ss 3 color designs!?
  There are at least 31 different colors here!
  
# Are you're boring websites static out of there mind?
  - Well here we have 5 nyan cats that constantly fly around and bounce from the walls than turn around! 
  - We, here, also have a Java (best language) logo that is affected by physically correct_-ish_ gravity!

# Are there not enough useless sidebar ads in your homepage page!?
  - Here we have at least 2 of the same, top ad. With which you may find out which salad YOU are!?
  - Just be careful, since one sidebar ad will bring you to THE BuzzFeed article; the other sidebar ad, however, may download a 5p00ky v1ru5!

# Oh yeah and this website also has all of the things a basic, normal, boring, predictable homepage has, well not all, but most!
  - There is a Google, the good, search bar.
  - There are quick bookmar link buttons.
  - There is a cool custom _maybe stolen (that's original)_ title.
  - There is a basic minimalistic background in there somewhere.
  - There is no sound. Because I can't be bothered.
  - There is a light mode option, for it:
      - press: Shift + Ctrl + K (Firefox). _Find keybind for your web browser yourself._
      - paste this into the console: document.body.children.forEach((element) => {element.style.filter = "brightness(1000%)"}); document.body.style.background = "#EEE"
        _I'm not sorry, it's stlightly under developed._
